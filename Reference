//Advanced Javascript

Primitives | Everything 

Numbers, strings, boolean, undefined, null  | Arrays, Functions, objects, dates, wrappers for nums, strings, booleans


{Object Oriented Programming:}

Objects interact with one another through methods and properties

Used to store data, structure applications into modules and keeping code clean.

We can create one main object (blue print object) also called as constructor or protoype.
we can create other objects based on it. constructor creates instance of objects

{Inheritance:}

One object based on other object

person {       Athelete {               Athlete {
 var sai           var charan               var sai
                                            var charan
}                       }                   }


javascript is a prototype based lang. which means inhertiance works using prototype.
Each object in JS have prototype


constructors prototype will belong to all the objects created by it.


{Summary:}

Every JS object has a prototype propert, which makes inheritance possible in JS.

The prototype property of an object is where we put methods and properties that we want other objects to inherit

The constructor's prototype property is NOT the prototype property of the constructor itself,
it's the prototype of ALL instances created through it

when a certain method or property is called, the search starts in the object itself, and if it cannot be found,
the search moves on to the object's prototype. This continues till the method is found:
This process is called as PROTOTYPE CHAIN


Function Constructor is always written as first letter capital like Person (P capital)

Ln:18 / when you write a new object will be created


{In Console - Prototype Methods}

john._proto_ === Person.prototype;


john.hasOwnProperty('')   --> true or false

john instanceOf Person --> true


{Creating Objects}


Object.create method. 

Object.create builds on obj that inherits directly whereas function constructor inherits from prototype property.


//Primitives vs objects

Var containing primi actually hold data inside it self in obj -> variable associated contains the reference in memeory.



//Objects and Functions

A function is an instance of an object.
A function behaves like any other object.
we can store functions in a variable
we can pass a function as an argument to another function
we can also return a function from a function

Above are called first class functions.

{Closure}

An inner function has always access to the variable and parameters of its outer function,
even after the outer function has returned.

A new function gets a new execution context.
